          <h3 class="groovy">What is pair programming</h3>
          <p>Pair programming is incorporating the use of two programmers and two sets of eyes into finding one solution. A lot of agile teams like to use pair programming.

          <h3 class="groovy">Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
          <p>This gets you used to working together. It also makes sure both people's opinions are incorporated into the problem. Double checks for syntactical and logical errors. Keeps ideas flowing and able to bounce off one another.</p>

            <h3 class="groovy">Reflection</h3>
              <p>This was a lot of fun to work together and build and style a page together in real time.I think that it was useful to have the driver navigator role so that we could allow for the driver to do the typing while the navigator checked the work and looked for areas that might need improvement.</p>
