        <h2>Stereotypes</h2>
        <p> <!--Put a post in here-->So obviously we are all subject to being stereotyped throughout our day to day activities. I feel like it's our responsibility individually to overcome these threats. Placing ourselves in situations that allow for stereotype threats to be a part of our interactions can be avoided in most instances. Sure, we can't avoid every situation that a stereotype might come into play, but we can interact with people in our surroundings in a responsible and understanding way. If people treat each other with kindness and understanding, it's much easier for certain types of stereotype threats to be eliminated. </p>                         <br>

        <p>A lot of people play into stereotypes without knowing that that's what they are doing. Allowing yourself to feel inferior to someone else because of a perception can really be detrimental to overcoming stereotypes. Trying to build confidence through small goal achievievments is a huge deterrent of stereotypes. If people can realize that they are able to make progress in some area, and that perhaps they do not start out being the best at something, but that they are working towards being better, they have the opportunity to overcome a certain stereotype. It takes work from both sides involved in a stereotype opportunity to squash that feeling and make situations easier for everyone to be a part of. If you are a person that is on the positive side of a stereotype, you should be humble enough to encourage someone else to work hard to achieve a level of understanding that you have obtained. You should be eager to gain praise for bringing this understanding into someone else's life. On the other hand, if you are the person that a stereotype shines a negative light on, it's your responsibility to be happy with yourself. So much of our lives are based on our perceptions and emotions. If we can strive to find happiness and allow for our troubles to be washed away by seeking out positive reinforcement, we can overcome stereotypes. </p>
        <br>
        <p>This belief obviously doesn't pertain to certain aspects of stereotypes. Instances of racial or gender inequality and other such stereotypes are perhaps a different kind of issue. I do feel like these issues can be met with understanding by the people that feel like they are being stereotyped. Sometimes you have to understand that people are ignorant. Maybe that's a stereotype in itself, but some issues shouldn't exist. If people could all treat each other with kindness and feel like we're all here to work together towards making life better, so many issues could diminish. I'll say it again, it takes understanding. Sometimes people are better at things than we are, but what does that really matter. If we can find a way to be happy and gain knowledge from others that may have more than we do, we can all exist together more peacefully and with less stress from feeling stereotyped as a certain way or another.</p>

        <p>BE HAPPY WITH YOURSELF
