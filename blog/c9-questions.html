        <p> <!--Put a post in here-->It seems to be a common occurrence when asking questions to beat around the bush. I just mean that a lot of times, people are not as specific as they could be. In order to get a real meaningful answer to something, you should always be as specific and precise as you can be. This may seem like you're being long-winded, but actually it is necessary for other people to process where you are in your head with the question and just how much they may need to impart.</p>

        <p>I suppose the most common questions that I have had most recently pertain to writing code, or something having to do with code. I have been at fault for being less specific than I should have been. When the person has to begin answering a question with questions of their own, this is a good indicator that you can provide more details into what it is you need to know. I have seen lots of times when a question is posed on a forum and the contributors reply back with questions asking for code examples. This is always a good idea to include what you are working with to allow others to look for simple mistakes, or to just have a window into your logic. You should also provide fine details into what language you are dealing with and perhaps what versions you use or are testing with. So again, this part resides under specificity. Include everything you have and have thought of to make the responses you get back easier to formulate. </p>

        <p>The last statement needs a little clarification. I said to include everything you have, but I think that's a bit of an overstatement. What I probably should have said was to include everything relevant to the question. Someone doesn't want to look through your entire code to search for the part you are asking about. So, keeping your question substance relevant is important as well.</p>

        <p>The last bit of thought I have on good questions is about closure. You should be able to clearly provide a description of the end result you are looking for. This can fall under being specific as well, but it's really important to convey to others exactly what it is you are trying to produce or comprehend.</p>
