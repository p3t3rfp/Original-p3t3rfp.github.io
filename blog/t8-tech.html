        <p> <!--Put a post in here-->Test driven development is a very important part of learning to become a solid developer in the industry. For me, this has been a crucial step in my understanding of what is being asked of me. I have had trouble with the first steps in my process so much of the time. It has been beneficial for me to see some test code that is asking exactly the right question. I think that that is the avenue in which I might find my best practice. I have really enjoyed being able to come together with people that I don't know and work to find solutions to problems. </p>
        <p>It almost seems like an easy task to find the problems with code when there are checks in place, but I know that it will get more difficult. It can be an art to know what the problems will be with what is being asked of you, and to be able to find the right solution may sometimes take some time. I'm not the best at writing driver code, but working with it is what has been most comfortable for me in this whole process. I have been able to learn so much from fixing broken code.</p>
        <p>I had an opportunity to write the user stories for our group challenge. I was returned code that reflected the stories that I produced. Perhaps this was a simple challenge, but it was encouraging to me to feel like I could actually build on the confidence that I had an understanding of what the process was. I like the group atmosphere of taking an idea and producing working code from examples that are given at the start.</p>
