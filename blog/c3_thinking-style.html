        <p> <!--Put a post in here-->My thinking style (so I'm told by <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">this</a> quiz) is that of an abstract sequential thinker. I was fairly close to the concrete sequential thinker as well, but I'll take what I was given. I do feel like I can agree with the majority of definitions of this thinking style. I agree that I learn well by myself, and that it's hard for me to express my emotions sometimes. I also agree that I struggle when I'm feeling rushed. I don't think I keep my full attention to the task at hand when time is of the essence. And I truly do feel like I feel a sense of comfort when I have access to experts or references.</p>

        <p>So far, my experience at DBC has been mixed. I do find myself playing the "Imposter Syndrome" role if I get a little hung up on things. As we are doing more and more, and as I'm putting myself out there in the crowd, I feel like this is getting lesser. I'm gaining confidence in myself that I feel is due to being surrounded by good people. Most everyone here is facing struggles of their own that are very similar to one another. This brings on a sense of belonging and togetherness that will help us all through. So, I think the brightest point in my thinking style, that I have access to experts and references, is going to keep me engaged and motivated to push forward. I'm going to strive to remain in the conversation and make sure my opinions are heard.</p>

        <h2>Mindset</h2>

        <p>I would love to believe that I am of the growth mindset. I do feel like I am not satisfied with simple goals in my future. I feel curious and like to seek out reasons for why things are why they are. I'm excited to journey into these realms with the people at DBC. I like the approach of always looking further and I am hopeful that I will hone my skills to better achieve this. I do agree that keeping an open mind and allowing external influences to make you question your own thinking are healthy. I think a growth mindset is not only beneficial for yourself, but also those that you interact with. </p>
