        <h2>Ruby Variable Scope</h2>
        <p> <!--Put a post in here-->There are four distinct types of variables in Ruby programming. These are: Global, class, instance and local. I will attempt to describe the difference in these variable types and the common use of them.</p>
        <h3>Global</h3>
        <p>Global variables can be recognized by the $ that precedes them in their declaration. Here's an example: $hi_there = "Hi there". Global variables are accessible anywhere in your code. This means that they can also be changed anywhere in your program as well, and this can lead to issues with tracking them.</p>
        <h3>Class</h3>
        <p>Class variable are preceded by two @ symbols like this: @@variable = "something". Class variables are similar to global variables, but they are only accessible to instances of objects inside of a class. Objects from other Classes cannot access them. If you change the value of a class variable, it will in affect change the value for each instance of an object using that variable within that class.</p>
        <h3>Instance</h3>
        <p>Instance variables are declared in this way: @something = "some thing". You can see that they are similar to class variables, but only contain a single @ symbol. Instance variables are only accessible to other objects inside of their same class. They can be used by other instances of objects and have separate values for each one. If you assign a value to the instance variable for one object, it can be changed and used by another instance of an object without affecting the other object. </p>
        <h3>Local</h3>
        <p>Local variables are declared by using either a lower case letter or underscore to begin like this: someVariable = 6 or _this_works_too = 5. Local variables are only available locally to their declaration. This means that they can only be used by the method or loop in which they are created. They cannot be accessed or used outside of those. You can use the same local variable again and again as long as it is contained inside of a block of code.
