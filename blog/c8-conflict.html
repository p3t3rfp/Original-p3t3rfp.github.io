        <p> <!--Put a post in here-->I think that the most troubling time in my life was due to the death of my mother. I was 17 years old, knew everything as I was a senior in high school, and was in for the most difficult time in my life. I feel like I had an emotional conflict with myself that spilled over into most every other relationship in my life. </p>
        <p>The death of a loved one, especially a parent, is never an easy situation to find yourself in. Taking on this situation as a senior in high school, for me, was probably one of the worst times this could have happened. I was already practicing avoidance techniques to keep other emotions at bay, but to throw this into the mix was too much for me to process. I fell deeper and further into drug and alcohol abuse to avoid truly processing the emotions associated with the grieving process. It's painful to feel the entirety of your emotions. The loss of a figure in your life that should be super instrumental into the further development of your emotions as you cross into actual adulthood is devastating. I feel like my handling of this loss created a pathway for me to form some of the worst habits that have been so hard to change. Drug and alcohol use on their own are bad enough, but to associate these habits with the avoidance of dealing with sorrow and despair can really fuck with your head and shape how you form relationships as you progress, or stagnantly exist, through life. </p>
        <p>So, to take a look back at the ways in which I conducted myself and dealt with the situation, I have a hard time drawing positive feelings about it. I had numerous opportunities to pull myself together and find a better way to carry on. I squandered most of these opportunites and broke many relationships apart, most notably, my 1st marriage. To be able to clearly look back on this now, I can see that searching for comfort in a high school relationship was just another avoidance technique I put into practice. I hastily rushed into marriage without having the proper tools needed for conducting a healthy relationship built to last. Eventually, this marriage ended due in part to the alcohol abuse that consumed me and my ability to truly deal with emotions as they came into my life. Avoiding all of the negative issues in your life will never get you very far. </p>
        <p>So, I was cast further into despair and needed to avoid even more strong emotions. I lived in this way for some time, and the environment that I surrounded myself with allowed for this. It wasn't until I met Mary Anne, my super-awesome, loving, caring, expressing (sometimes overly), sharing, wife. Certainly it wasn't the magic relationship that cured me immediately, but it was the first step in my life to becoming a much stroger emotional person. We shared some of the same hurt in our lives. We both had lost our mothers and both had been recently divorced. Through our discussions on this, we have recognized that our coming together perhaps is yet another avoidance technique for both of us. But at this point in our lives, we're able to think about this and realize that even though we may not have formed our relationship on the strongest foundation, what we have accomplished together is something that we both can appreciate and work harder to continue to build.</p>
        <p>If I were able to go back to deal with this conflict in my life I would have definitely dealt with this differently. The strongest feeling I have on what I would do differently would be to listen to my father. He probably gave me sound advice pertaining to waiting on getting married, and not avoiding emotions through substance abuse. I know that he did, I just didn't listen. I really wish I would have. I feel like I'm a little bit behind when it comes to building healthly relationships with other people, but having found my AWESOME wife and working through struggles with her instead of avoiding them has given me a new lease on life. It also really helps to have 2 cool kids to be responsible for in my life too! This was one of the hardest times in my life, but feeling like I'm coming out on the other side is encouraging to me to feel like I'm shaking those habits of avoidance.
