        <p> <!--Put a post in here-->Arrays and hashes are useful for containing large amounts of elements in a single place. Both are able to accept more elements and store them, or remove or change the value of the elements contained within them.

          Arrays can be set up by either using literal notation:
          array = []

          Or, you can use an array object constructor:

          array = Array.new

          Array's elements are accesible by their index number. Such that:
          array=[1,4,6,7]

          array[1]  => will output the element in the second position [4]

          Arrays are indexed starting with 0 as the first position, or as Chris Pine said, "zeroith" position. The first element will have an index[0]. Every array will contain the number of indexes equal to array.length - 1 because you start with 0 as your first index position. You are able to delete elements or add elements to arrays, or even change the value of an index position in arrays.

          Arrays are capable of containing arrays themselves too. These are called multi-dimensional arrays:

          array =[['good','bad','ugly'],[3,2,1],['here',1,'we','go',2]]

          The arrays contained within the array are called sub-arrays. Each of their elements are accesible by first calling the parent array's index number and then the element itself's index:

          array[2][1] => should give you 2!

          I hope I'm right on that!

          To add elements to arrays, you can use array.push[]. This will add whatever you input to the end of the array.

          You can also use array.pop, and this will remove the last element of the array and tell you what it was.

          I won't lie, I still have so much more to learn about utilizing the power of arrays.

          Moving on to hashes........

          Hashes are similar to arrays in that they are able to store large amounts of elements in a single place. The main difference is that hashes use a key:value pair structure. Each element in a hash is either an object key, or the value associated with that object. The creation of hashes is similar to arrays.

          my_hash = {'one' => 'thing'}

          Or, you can use the literal notation:

          my_hash = Hash.new

          As you can see, the set up is slightly different for making the key:value pairs. You must use the '=>' notation to assign a value to a key. Keys and values can be any ruby objects.

          To access either one from the hash, use this notation:

          puts "#{either key or value}"

          This just scrapes the surface of how and when you can use these two objects, but I need so much more practice to be able to explain them more in depth.

          Again, so much more to learn about the awesome power of these two objects. More to come as I come more into all of this.
