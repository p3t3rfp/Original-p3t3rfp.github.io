         <!--Put a post in here--><h1>Is the End Near?!?</h1>
         <p>So I looked online at some of the issues facing the IT industry, and this one issue caught my attention. <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/burnout">Burnout</a> among IT workers is increasing and seems to be inevitable for some.
        </p>
        <p>Burnout is defined by Merriam Webster as: the condition of someone who has become very physically and emotionally tired after doing a difficult job for a long time. This to some sounds like an inescapable outcome for so many in the tech industry. The hours and work load can be extremely demanding and grueling at times, and it only seems like it's getting worse with budgets decreasing and the expectations of workers moving up. So, does all this really have to do simply with stress from what is expected from us at our jobs? Or, are there other contributing factors that can play into the ways that we perceive ourselves and our work?</p>

        <p>According to an <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140916092703.htm">article</a> on ScienceDaily, there are a number of other sources in our lives that can shape the way we function. The articles cites a study by the Universite de Montreal, and it finds that more often than not, a person's homelife is just as much of a contributing factor to their mental health state as the stresses of work. It says,
          <div><em>
          <p>"Turns out mental health in the workplace doesn't exist in a vacuum: it's deeply affected by the rest of a person's day-to-day life. And vice versa.</p>

        <p>The study shows that fewer mental health problems are experienced by those living with a partner, in households with young children, higher household incomes, less work-family conflicts, and greater access to the support of a social network outside the workplace.</p>
        <p>Of course, factors within the workplace are still important. Fewer mental health problems were reported when employees are supported at work, when expectations of job recognition are met, and when people feel secure in their jobs. A higher level of skill use is also associated with lower levels of depression, pointing to the importance of designing tasks that motivate and challenge workers.</p>

        <p>"This is a call to action," says senior author Steve Harvey, professor of management and dean of Concordia's John Molson School of Business. "Researchers need to expand their perspective, so that they get a full picture of the complexity of factors that determine individuals' mental health.""</p></em>
      </div>
        <p>Drawing my own conclusion from these findings, I feel like the biggest responsibility in all of this falls on us as individuals. We are responsible for placing ourselves in situations that make us comfortable or allow for our continued growth. If there are stresses in our lives, we need to seek out solutions that will put the discomfort at bay. I'm not trying to say that all this is easy, but it can be lessened and sometimes avoided. I do feel like it is in part the responsibility of employers to provide a workplace that is welcoming and appreciative of its' employees. People seem to find satisfaction when they feel appreciated or are praised for their efforts. I think in the end, if we seek out happiness hard enough, we can make our lives better and more fulfilling.</p>
