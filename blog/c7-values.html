          <h1>Having Worth Means Being Worthy</h1>
          <p>I feel like the happiest I've been in my life would have to be when I welcomed my first son into this world. It's hard not to say that I achieved that same level of happiness again when my second son arrived. The overwhelming, hugely surreal, feelings associated with a new life appearing before your eyes is hard to describe to those that have not experienced it for themselves, but believe me, it's incredible. For some, myself included, everything that you've had going on in your life seems a little less important, and you can be left wondering what the hell you were doing before you had such huge responsiblity to attend to. Taking on this new responsibility opens avenues of inquiries into what is really important to you, and reshapes many ideas and ideals in your life. I think that it's a transformational experience that can lead to the untapped potential in humans to become truly loving beings.</p>

          <p>I feel like having a family that you create is one of the most important things you can undertake in this life. It can bring on the best of times, and certainly test your patience the whole way through, but in my experiences, the enormous amount of positive gains have been life changing. I have found myself happiest when I can provide for the other people in my family. I am much happier to see the one's around me smile. I feel like having a family has been the best change in my life. The most exciting part is that it should continue and can get even better.</p>

          <p>I'll have to be honest, I have not been the best person in the world in my relationship. I have tested patience and boundaries, but have always tried to stay positive and focused on the continuation of a relationship that can be worked on and made better. I think throughout the years with my wife and children, I have made improvements in the way I interact, not only with them, but have greatly improved my personal skills with other people as well. I strive to live up to the highest standards when it comes to my family.</p>

          <p>My wife and I have had lengthy discussions on sterotypes lately. We have talked about people's perceptions of tattoos and how they relate to our professional experiences. I feel like tattoos are becoming more and more widely accepted, but she sometimes feels skeptical because she sports two full sleeves, and even though she is a photographer, she feels like the stereotype threat can creep in. I can certainly see her side in some instances, but overall feel like it's something that you have to first be comfortable with personally before you can truly shed someone else's perception. Whenever someone feels like their moral character is is question, it obviously makes them uneasy, and this can take away from their abilities as an artist before they are given a chance. Knowing the situation that one will be involved in can greatly reduce any threat before it arises.</p>

          <p>I'm struggling with the fact that I'll be removed for a time from my family while I'm at DBC. I know that it'll be harder for my wife who is trying to work and take care of our two boys than it will for me. I feel a bit of pressure to excell so that it's all worthwhile to take the time away. I know that I can count on my family for support and that in the end, they're not going anywhere and we'll have most of the rest of the time to continue building on what we have.</p>
