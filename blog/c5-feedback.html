        <h2>Feedback and all that</h2>
        <p> <!--Put a post in here-->Uhhhh...... Yeah. So I do think it's really important to holla back at folks to let them know what you think about the way in which you interact. Giving people a way to reflect on the actions and thinkings they have in respect to interactions with other people is really valuable. It provides a way to step back and look at yourself as others see you. I know that this is something that is really difficult for a lot of people. I will bundle myself in to that catergory. Nobody really likes "feedback" if it's not good feedback. I do think that as people allow themselves to be more open to the way other's perceive them, they become better at adapting to more varieties of situations. The more adaptable you become, the more comfortable you become, and I think, the happier you become. I think that improving the way in which you are able to take and process feedback from others is invaluable to growth as a person.
        </p>

        <p>The feedback that I have received during this phase at DBC has been a tremendous confidence booster. I think that I'm hard on myself and maybe too critical at times. So, the positive feedback that I have received has been really helpful for me. I'm not sure that all the feedback that shows up for me is actually intended for me, but I'll take it! I have been able to take pieces of advice from the feedback and use it to change some of the ways that I operate. I didn't have strong knowledge of pseudocoding before, but I knew that it was something that I needed to work on. I have gotten a couple pieces of feedback cementing that fact. I know for sure if it's something I'm thinking, and then someone else clearly sees it as a point to improve on, that indeed I need to work on that. All of the feedback for me has been received in a gracious manner. I want more of it. I think once you see the benefit of it, and how it can make you become better in areas you weren't even thinking about, you want more and more of it.</p>

        <p>As far as the feedback that I have given..........Well, I think that I have gotten better at trying to be specific and find small things for others to work on. It's been a little bit hard for me simply because the majority of people that I have worked with have been really exceptional in their communication skills and logic. I know that I have been kind, but that's easy when you have gained something from someone. Again, it's hard to give actionable feedback to someone that you feel is guiding you. But, small things matter when it comes to feedback. So, even if I feel like I didn't have much to offer, positive re-inforcement is also beneficial to others to let them know that whay they are doing is a good thing.</p>
        <h3>Pairing</h3>
        <p>I was so apprehensive to the idea of pairing coming into this. I guess I was nervous that I would look dumb or say the wrong thing. You know, all the standard insecurities that come with being out of your element. I should have prefaced that with the fact that I have not been the most extroverted person around. Every one of my pairing sessions has been such a joy to be in. I have learned so much from others, and have found that I'm not alone in my feelings too. I think that once you begin to reach out, you find that you're not so different from anyone else really. I have benefitted technically from the majority of my pairing sessions. Some of the people that I have worked with have been so patient and willing to take the time to allow me to find solutions without just telling me what to do. That aspect of it has been the best for me to build confidence with. I'm looking forward to pairing sessions now (although I do still feel a little nervous!) and am beginning to feel more confident going into them. I see the value in pairing with people and finding solutions that come from two minds. There's a lot of truth to the saying "Two heads are better than one".</p>
