        <p> <!--Put a post in here-->I have never thought of myself as someone that would ever blog about anything. It's not that I don't like to take part in discussions and share ideas about things, but it just seems like so many people become all consumed in their own ideas and opinions through their blog posts. I will have to say that through this process I have perhaps had a shift of my own opinion on this. I have learned so much by putting my thoughts down somewhere and allowing others access to read and respond to them. I feel like I have allowed myself to ask for criticism in the hopes that I can become better and make progress. I think that this is important in doing just that.</p>

        <p>I have really enjoyed creating this site and making tweaks to the CSS, trying to get things just right. I don't feel like I failed, but I still have much to work on and make better. Integrating the blog posts into the website proved to be some difficult for me. For some reason, I didn't have the foresight to bundle the two together. I mean that I didn't use the same header and footer and other structures for both the main website and the blog. I created them as separate things, and this made a bit more work for me to pull them together later. I think I learned a lesson in planning due to this. I will try to think ahead more clearly before jumping into a project. It pays to spend a little extra time upfront, planning, than to have to come back later and spend more time making adjustments and fixes.</p>

        <p>I see the value in writing blog posts about topics. Whether they are technical posts or cultural posts doesn't really matter. Each has benefit from thinking about  and expressing ideas on the topic. For the technical posts, usually it requires me to do some additional research on topics to get a better understanding. This helps to learn more as I go. For the cultural posts, this is a time to reflect on the ideas and morals that I embody. I think it's always important to either know or to want to know how you feel about something. It helps you grow as an individual and also become a stronger part of a community.</p>

        <p>So my experience of creating a website and trying out something new in blogging about it has been a success. I feel like I have learned a great deal and that I have accomplished some things as well. I have built confidence in myself being able to clearly express my ideas and feel like they have weight in a discussion. I am encouraged to continue doing this and hope that I can continue growing.</p>
