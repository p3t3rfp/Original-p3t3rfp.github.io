        <p> <!--Put a post in here-->Version control is a very useful tool that allows developers to have a safeguard in place for their work. Individuals and teams alike are able to collaborate on projects and work on the same files simultaneously without interferring with each other's work. By saving your work as often as you can, you create more checkpoints to fall back on and track progress. With version control you can access work from any one of these checkpoints and edit or add to it for consideration to the project as a whole. Any mistakes can be undone by pulling up an earlier version and knowing where you went wrong.

Git is great at keeping track of changes by enabling accountability for the work that you produce. It tracks files and changes through commits that you can attach a message with explaining what was done and why. You can can use git log to see all of the commits that were saved and go to any one of them to understand the changes better. So again, creating all of these checkpoints with explanations of what was done and when is super useful to keeping track of changes as projects progress.

Github is an extremely powerful collaboration tool. It lets teams work on certain aspects of projects, idividually and pool all of their resources back into master files contained there. Master source files live on Github, but can be accessed locally on your machine, edited and pushed back in for consideration or use. The use of Github is like a growing library that gets all the lastest editions of works and compiles them to make the best copy. Everyone involved is also able to track the progress and changes all the way through. It really keeps every one on the same page.
