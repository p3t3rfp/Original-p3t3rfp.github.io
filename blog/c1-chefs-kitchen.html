So, after watching Shereef talk about his thougts and vision of DBC, I'm even more excited to be a part of this program. I latched onto the idea that it is still experimental and evolving. I feel like he has a certain idea of the kind of drive and devotion it takes to make it in the industry, and he's continually reaching further to get that from his teachers and cohorts.

My impression of DBC is that it will be hugely challenging and demanding throughout the phases. I feel like the process of incorporating programming with emotional intelligence heightening is a big undertaking. I love that the two are seen as complimentary to each other in a sense. I'm ready to learn so much about both of these.

I want to think that phase-0 will be a big stepping stone for me. I have at times been somewhat shy and taken a backseat to others. I feel like being immersed in an atmoshpere that begs involvement from everyone will be helpful for me to become more comfortable and confident in my abilities. I am eager to gain more perspective on giving and receiving feedback to see how I can best improve.

I don't really think that my expectations have changed all that much. I suppose that I can say I am growing more excited to be involved in the program as we continue. I have always felt that it's going to be very demanding and challenging. So far, it has been a large amount of new learning, and I am sure that that will be the case to the end.

I can't say it enough. I'm really happy to be a part of this cohort. The first video on emotional intelligence really tickled my fancy. It made me feel like this program was so much more than a programmer factory churning out code-monkeys. I want to be around people that have interests and lives that are different from mine and all grow together.

I will admit to having some nervousness. I guess I fall into the "Imposter Syndrome" mindset at times. I think that that comes from being new to most of this and having so much new information being thrust at me quickly. I will continue to find ways to build my confidence and feel like I truly have something to bring to the table at DBC.

I know they say sometimes there can be too many cooks in the kitchen, but I'm ready to learn to cook with you all for an army.
